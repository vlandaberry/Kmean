# K-mean

This repository contains:
-a kmean function programmed in R:

Whit this function you can calculate the centers and the clasiffication in clusters using k-mean method of classification. 

- some codes on K-means using the R function kmean.

- real data analysis using k-mean algortihm.


## K-mean function programmed in R

- The onevariable.R code has the code to apply K-mean over 1 variable. 
- The morethanone.R code has the code to apply  K-means with more than one variable
- The fullfunction.R has the code of k-mean algortihm for all cases

- The HowIdidit.Rmd is a file containing  a step by step explanation about what I did in each code and the elements I define.
